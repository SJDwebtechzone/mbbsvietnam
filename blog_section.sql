10	2	Introduction: Why Vietnam for MBBS	Vietnam has emerged as one of the most promising destinations for Indian students pursuing MBBS abroad. With affordable tuition fees, tropical climate, cultural familiarity, and high safety standards, Vietnam offers a strong return on investment. All universities listed here are NMC-compliant, offering a 54-month course plus 12-month internship. Teaching is entirely in English, and Indian hostel and mess facilities ensure comfort for students.
11	2	Dai Nam University (DNU) – Hanoi Heavyweight	Located in the capital city Hanoi, Dai Nam University was established in 2007 and has quickly become a leading private medical institution. The university is affiliated with more than 16 hospitals across Hanoi, giving students extensive clinical exposure. It also partners with Hanoi Medical University, ranked among the top medical schools in Asia. DNU is equipped with advanced diagnostic technologies such as the 2560-slice CT Scan machine. The curriculum is NEXT-focused, with Indian faculty guiding students through exam preparation. Fees: Tuition ₹3,50,000/year, Hostel ₹80,000–1,00,000/year, Total package for 6 years ₹33–35 Lakhs.
12	2	Phan Chau Trinh University (PCTU) – Clinical & Research Leader	Situated in Da Nang, PCTU is renowned for its cutting-edge infrastructure and USMLE-integrated curriculum. It is the only university in Vietnam with a Simulation Hospital, allowing students to practice safely before treating real patients. The Medical Museum provides hands-on anatomical and pathology study, while the Stem Cell Research Centre offers exposure to regenerative medicine. PCTU owns 9 hospitals with over 1,500 beds, ensuring unmatched clinical training. Collaborations with Stanford University and UCSF bring global expertise to the classroom. Fees: Tuition ₹4,80,000/year, Hostel ₹1,50,000–1,90,000/year, Total package for 6 years ₹43–45 Lakhs.
13	2	Can Tho University of Medicine & Pharmacy (CTUMP) – Government Prestige	Established in 1979, CTUMP is a government-run institution located in Can Tho City, the heart of the Mekong Delta. With a sprawling 83-acre campus and more than 45 years of academic heritage, CTUMP is a symbol of prestige and stability. The university operates its own 500-bed teaching hospital, serving over 30,000 outpatients monthly. Clinical training begins as early as the second year, giving students early exposure to real-world cases. CTUMP also maintains strong international research collaborations. Fees: Tuition ₹5,20,000–5,50,000/year, Hostel ₹1,50,000–2,00,000/year, Total package for 6 years ₹47–50 Lakhs.
14	2	Buon Ma Thuot Medical University (BMU) – Modern Medical Hub	Located in Buon Ma Thuot in the Central Highlands, BMU is a modern private medical university with rapidly growing reputation. It operates a 500-bed multi-specialty hospital on campus, handling over 33,000 outpatients monthly and 20,000 surgeries annually.

Fees: Tuition ₹4,00,000/year, Hostel ₹1,00,000–1,20,000/year, Total package for 6 years ₹39–41 Lakhs.
15	2	Comparison & Decision Guide	Among the top four universities, Dai Nam University is the most budget-friendly option, ideal for students seeking affordability with capital city exposure. Phan Chau Trinh University stands out for advanced technology, simulation hospital, and USMLE preparation. Can Tho University offers government prestige and stability, making it attractive for students who value heritage and credibility. Buon Ma Thuot University provides modern infrastructure, high patient flow, and scholarships, making it a balanced choice for practical exposure. Students should choose based on career goals, financial planning, and desired clinical exposure.
16	3	Introduction: The 2026 MBBS Dilemma	Thousands of Indian students unable to secure government seats or afford private colleges look abroad. Russia, Georgia, and Uzbekistan have been traditional destinations, but Vietnam has emerged as a new contender. The choice is no longer about quantity but quality — Vietnam offers a niche, high-standard education with around 400 Indian students enrolled.
17	3	Clinical Exposure & Cadaver Training	Russia, Georgia, and Uzbekistan often restrict cadaver use due to legal or religious reasons, relying on silicon models and digital simulations. In contrast, Vietnam universities like PCTU and Can Tho offer real cadaver dissections from the first year, combined with 3D anatomy tables. This hands-on approach builds surgical confidence unmatched by simulation-only training.
18	3	NEXT Exam Readiness & Disease Spectrum	Russia and Georgia's cold climates expose students to diseases like frostbite and tick-borne encephalitis, irrelevant to India. Vietnam shares a tropical climate similar to India, with cases of Malaria, Dengue, Typhoid, and Tuberculosis. This ensures students are NEXT-ready, as they train on the same disease spectrum they will face in Indian hospitals.
19	3	Language Barrier: English vs Bilingual	In Russia and CIS countries, courses are often bilingual — English in early years, but local languages (Russian, Mandarin) dominate clinical rotations. This weakens practical training. Vietnam offers 100% English-medium instruction, with textbooks, exams, and faculty all in English. Students learn basic Vietnamese for daily life, but academics remain fully English-focused.
20	3	Travel & Connectivity	Russia and Georgia require 10–15 hours of travel with costly tickets (₹60,000–90,000 round trip). Vietnam is only 4–4.5 hours away with affordable flights (₹18,000–25,000 round trip). Parents can easily visit, and Aieraa organizes dedicated Parents' Tours for inspection of hostels and universities. Over six years, students save around ₹3 Lakhs in travel costs by choosing Vietnam.
21	3	Living Conditions & Hostel Facilities	In Russia and Georgia, students often face the "Cooking Trap" — living in private apartments, spending hours cooking, and surviving on poor nutrition. Vietnam eliminates this struggle with Aieraa-managed hostels. Indian chefs provide North Indian, South Indian, and Andhra-style menus daily, with vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and Halal options. Hostels are safe, separate for boys and girls, and equipped with modern amenities like Wi-Fi and air conditioning.
22	3	Geopolitics & Safety	Russia and Ukraine face instability, sanctions, and currency volatility, disrupting education. Vietnam, by contrast, is politically stable and safe, with strong India-Vietnam diplomatic ties. The Global Peace Index ranks Vietnam high for safety, especially for women. Students can focus on studies without geopolitical anxiety.
23	3	Financial Breakdown: Tuition & Hidden Costs	Vietnam tuition fees range from ₹21–30 Lakhs for the entire 6-year course, with no donations or capitation fees. Travel costs are significantly lower compared to Russia/Georgia. Aieraa offers a one-time processing package (~₹2.86 Lakhs) covering visa, flights, and documentation, avoiding recurring hidden charges. Overall, Vietnam is the most cost-effective option.
24	3	Conclusion: Why Vietnam is the Future	Vietnam offers US-aligned curriculum, real cadaver training, tropical disease exposure, English-medium teaching, affordable travel, safe living conditions, and political stability. While Russia and Georgia remain crowded with mass-education models, informed students are choosing Vietnam for quality, NEXT readiness, and financial advantage. In 2026, Vietnam is the smart choice for Indian MBBS aspirants.
